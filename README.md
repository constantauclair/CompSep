# CompSep : statistical component separations using Wavelet Phase Harmonics (WPH) statistics
CompSep contains Python codes to perform statistical component separations on 2D data using WPH statistics.
The codes allow to separate a unknown signal of interest from a contamination of which we have a set of realizations. \

Add. \

All the codes have been written with Python 3.9.1 and using PyWPH 1.1 (https://github.com/bregaldo/pywph), NumPy 1.20.1, PyTorch 2.0.0, and SciPy 1.6.0.
